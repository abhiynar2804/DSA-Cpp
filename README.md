# DSA in C++

This repository contains my Data Structures & Algorithms practice in C++.
I am solving problems regularly, mainly from LeetCode, focusing on
clean code and approach-based solutions.

## Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Strings
- Recursion (ongoing)

## Practice Details
- Language: C++
- Source: LeetCode
- Each file includes:
  - Problem name
  - Approach used
  - Clean implementation

## Goal
Build strong problem-solving skills for technical interviews.
